  "requirements": "Can you help me using esp-idf to implements the following requirements using the esp32s3.\n\nWrite a program to blink an LED to encode the message \u201cSOS\u201d in Morse code. In Morse code, each letter is represented by a series of dots (short tones) and dashes (long tones). You should write a program that replicates this pattern on the LED. For dots, the LED should blink at around twice the speed/frequency of dashes. \n\n\nThe LED is connected to the GPIO 13."
