  "requirements": "Can you help me using esp-idf to implements the following requirements using the esp32s3.\n\nBuild the circuit and write a program to simultaneously blink (toggle) two LEDs using two separate timers: the first LED blinks at every 500 msec and another LED at every 1 sec. The expectation is that the toggling rate is adjusted via the timer configuration and no explicit timing-related functions, such as delay(), are used.\n\n\nThe first LED is connected to the GPIO 13. The second LED is connected to GPIO 21."
