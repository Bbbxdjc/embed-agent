Can you help me using esp-idf to implements the following requirements using the esp32s3.

Write a program to blink an LED to encode the message “SOS” in Morse code. In Morse code, each letter is represented by a series of dots (short tones) and dashes (long tones). You should write a program that replicates this pattern on the LED. For dots, the LED should blink at around twice the speed/frequency of dashes. 


The LED is connected to the GPIO 13.
